A set of Matlab scripts that leverages MTEX toolbox for plotting field structural data and rotating specimen data to a field/geographic reference frame.

Although I try to comment the code and have provided an example script, I recognize that it may be unclear how to use this toolbox. Please feel free to contact me for assistance of any kind or to report bugs. You can also submit an issue on GitHub, and I will reply.
